## Introduction

A data structure is a particular way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. Data structures are fundamental to designing efficient algorithms and are widely used in computer science and software engineering. 

## Why Use Data Structures?

Data structures provide a means to manage large amounts of data efficiently for uses such as large databases and internet indexing services. Efficient data structures are key to designing efficient algorithms. Some key reasons to use data structures include:

- **Efficiency**: Optimizing operations like search, insertion, deletion, and update.
- **Reusability**: Code that uses data structures can be more modular and reusable.
- **Abstraction**: They provide a means to manage data complexity by abstracting details.

## Common Data Structures

### Arrays

An array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations. The idea is to store multiple items of the same type together. This makes it easy to calculate the position of each element by simply adding an offset to a base value.

- **Operations**: Access, Search, Insertion, Deletion
- **Use Cases**: Storing collection of data where elements are the same type

### Linked List

A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. The elements in a linked list are linked using pointers.

- **Operations**: Traversal, Insertion, Deletion
- **Types**: Singly Linked List, Doubly Linked List, Circular Linked List
- **Use Cases**: Dynamic memory allocation, implementing stacks and queues

### Stack

A stack is a linear data structure that follows a particular order for operations. The order may be LIFO (Last In First Out) or FILO (First In Last Out).

- **Operations**: Push, Pop, Peek, isEmpty, isFull
- **Use Cases**: Expression evaluation and syntax parsing, backtracking algorithms

### Queue

A queue is a linear structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is First In First Out (FIFO).

- **Operations**: Enqueue, Dequeue, Front, Rear, isEmpty, isFull
- **Types**: Simple Queue, Circular Queue, Priority Queue, Double-Ended Queue
- **Use Cases**: Handling requests in a single shared resource (e.g., printer, CPU scheduling)

### Tree

A tree is a hierarchical data structure that consists of nodes, with a single node as the root, from which nodes branch out to form a tree-like structure.

- **Operations**: Insertion, Deletion, Traversal (In-order, Pre-order, Post-order)
- **Types**: Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree (BST), AVL Tree, Red-Black Tree, B-Tree
- **Use Cases**: Hierarchical data representation (e.g., file systems), databases, network routing algorithms

### Graph

A graph is a collection of nodes, called vertices, and the connections between them, called edges. Graphs can be used to model pairwise relations between objects.

- **Operations**: Insertion, Deletion, Search (BFS, DFS)
- **Types**: Directed Graph, Undirected Graph, Weighted Graph, Unweighted Graph
- **Use Cases**: Social networks, web page linking, network topologies, pathfinding algorithms

### Hash Table

A hash table is a data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values.

- **Operations**: Insert, Delete, Search
- **Use Cases**: Database indexing, caches, sets
